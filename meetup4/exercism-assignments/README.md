We have regrouped the assignments by difficulty level.

Tips:

  - Start by commenting all the tests but the first one and proceed with baby steps from there
  - No assignments require the use of third party libraries, they can all be solved using
    the Elixir or Erlang standard library
  - The focus of Exercism is not only on the problem solving but mostly on the readability and
    cleanliness of the code so don't forget to refactor as you make progress

  Enjoy!
