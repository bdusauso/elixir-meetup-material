#
# Let's extend our little counter process example!
#
# Your tasks:
#  1) Implement an incrementable counter based on public API described below
#  2) Add a new Counter.dec/1 public function which decrements the counter
#  3) A counter must always remain >= 0, make sure an exception is raised otherwise.
#
#     You can raise an exception with:
#
#       raise ArgumentError, "error message"
#
#  Make baby steps and uncomment the test cases as you make progress
#
