Meetup 3
================

During meetup 3 we were studying mix and OTP coding a simple webapp call DAWS: Devspace Anagram Webserver.

Some code was simply copy-pasted by participants. Some functions had to be written.

* daws_copy_paste : directory with files we copy-pasted
* daws_complete : a ready application
* daws_with_missing_functions :  a few functions are missing. The tests will guide you to code those functions.
